# Public Spending & Institutional Quality – Integrated Analysis Project

## Overview
This university project explores the relationship between **public spending**, **institutional quality**, and **economic sustainability**, focusing on Greece, the European Union, and global benchmarks.

The project is split into two complementary components:
1. A **13-page policy report** analyzing theoretical and empirical aspects of public finance and governance.
2. An **Excel-based interactive dashboard** visualizing macroeconomic indicators such as debt (% of GDP), poverty rates, fiscal balance, and default events across selected years.

## Deliverables
- **Policy_Report (Word).docx**  
  A well-structured academic report that includes literature review, comparative analysis, policy insights, and proposals.  
  Written in Greek, based on academic and statistical sources.

- **Public Finance Dashboard (Excel).xlsx**  
  A visual dashboard using pivot tables, bar/pie/radar charts, and slicers to provide dynamic insights into key public finance indicators between 2009–2018.
